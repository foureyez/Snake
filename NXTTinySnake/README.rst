NXT TinySnake - The Origin
===========================

This code is the origin of the Snake Language Game. The NXT TinySnake was the
first implementation of a Snake game I did.

It was part of a coursework assignment for programming an embedded OS on top
of the Lego NXT.

The first assignment was implementing a Snake game providing a certain amount
of functionality. However, the second assignment was to reduce the overall 
size of the resulting object file as far as possible.

The code here was somewhere in the middle of the field, not minimal, but also
not to bad.

Since the overall framework and NXT OS is not provided here, the code is only
useful as an example, but not runnable/compilable by itself.
