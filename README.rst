Snake - The Language Game
=========================

This repository contains various Snake implementations in various different
programming languages.

For me, the Snake game became the favorite program to be written in a new
programming language after mastering `Hello World!`.

Its nature is simple, and the feature set usually constrained to the minimum,
however, it requirers the use of data structures and encourages exploration of
idiomatic language constructs.

It is not a lot more than the following ASCII drawing shows::

  /----------\
  |          |
  |oo        |
  |          |
  |  #       |
  | o#    o  |
  | o#####   |
  |      #   |
  |    ###   |
  |  o       |
  |          |
  \----------/GAME OVER

The basics are there, some user interaction is required, and sometimes it 
comes with a basic AI like the current Erlang version.

If you like the idea, join in, fork the project, and add an implementation in
your favorite language.
